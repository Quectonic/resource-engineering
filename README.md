# Resource Engineering

The Resource Engineering library is designed for web scraping tasks, gathering qualitative, textual data. The library fits usecases when scraping domain knowledge, articles, or similar formatted data. The original purpose of this library is to help engineers gather information they need for constructing datasets for LLM applications such as RAG, vector search, prompt engineering, fine tuning foundation models, etc.

*** Note: the primary goal of this library is not for extracting specific information from web pages and organizing web data into structured data format. ***
